6. **Component Structure & Design Decisions** ✅

   **Architecture Highlights:**
   - Modular, reusable components
   - Context API for centralized authentication
   - localStorage for data persistence
   - Separation of concerns (UI, Logic, Data)
   - DRY principle applied throughout

   **Key Design Decisions:**
   - Double-verification for student submissions (prevents accidental submits)
   - Progress bars for visual assignment tracking (at-a-glance status)
   - Role-based access (students see own data, admins see all students)
   - Mock data system allows testing without backend
   - localStorage enables cross-session persistence
